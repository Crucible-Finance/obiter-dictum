A small financial api / tool which is used to get short delayed information about stock tickers from finviz's and other APIs. 

The main usage is to get images for discord and slack servers, however it also is used to get some bare metrics on a ticker/symbol. 

The api is default consumable to slack, and often is used for discord inlue of paid services. 



# Usage

## Querying Endpoints

Each request is fetching informatin about a specific company or asset, we pass that symbol as `ticker` which you can pass in two different ways. 

In a `GET` Request you can use the query parameter `ticker` can be passed to specify which company or asset you would like to retrieve info about. 

```
curl https://obiter-dictum-prod.herokuapp.com/stock/info?ticker=m
```

or 

In a `POST` Request `ticker` can be the value for the key `text` in the body of a `POST`, make sure to pass the `"Content-Type: application/json"` header, and valid json. 

```
curl 
  -X POST https://obiter-dictum-prod.herokuapp.com/stock/info
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -d '{"text": "m"}'  
```
